# Age and Gender Prediction Project

For this project, we are going to perform gender and age prediction from
up-close images of people. We will make one single model that does both of
these tasks. Then, we will analyse the model from an ethical point of view
and describe what sort of dangers and caveats such models can have. The
dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new
